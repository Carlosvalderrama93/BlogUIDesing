# Firts page

![IMG web finished] (https://github.com/Carlosvalderrama93/Cuestionario-FAS/blob/main/Media/IMG-finished-project.png)

This Homepage is the first page that I develop.
At firts I wanted to do it with CSS Grid, but that development metodology was hard for me.
So finally I decided develop it with CSS Flex.

I thing that the page could be better, but for the firts page that I develop I feel it's fine.
Maybe later return to adapt the site for responsive design.

By now, I will start another page to learn other basics concepts of HTML and CSS, Responsive design, Git, github, Javascript and more.

It should be noted that I took as a basis for this page the blog called FIRMA that is avaible in: https://firma.eduardogomez.io/
But when I was developing this page, I felt that I was not learning in the way that I want.So in my next develop experience I will take a free UI design avaible in Figma. That with the idea of not to write code that I can't understand.

Final note: This page took me aproximatly 11 days with 8 hour work daily . I thing that the next page must be developed in fewer time.
